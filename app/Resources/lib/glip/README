glip is a Git Library In PHP. It allows you to access bare git repositories
from PHP scripts, even without having git installed. The project's homepage is
located at <http://fimml.at/glip>.

Key features:
    - pure PHP (reads Git repositories without system() calls)
    - can read packfiles (but not store them, and reading is somewhat
      inefficient)
    - low-level abstraction layer to deal with Git plumbing in its current
      shape, could be extended to provide a richer API
